0. What is Digital Interface Protocols
=======================================
Digital interface protocols are essential for enabling communication between different components 
in digital systems, such as processors, memory, and peripherals. These protocols define how data is 
transmitted and received, ensuring reliable and efficient communication.

While many digital interface protocols involve one end being connected to an SoC or CPU, it's 
not always the case. The exact configuration depends on the system architecture and the role of 
the protocol in the system. For internal communication, the SoC or CPU often plays a central role. 
For external communication or specialized functions, dedicated controllers or peripherals may handle 
the protocol, with the SoC or CPU interacting through additional interfaces or bus connections.
